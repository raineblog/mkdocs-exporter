# MkDocs Exporter

A specialized, Docker-based tool for exporting MkDocs documentation to PDF (via Selenium/Chrome) and LaTeX. Built on Alpine Linux for efficiency and tailored for the [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.

## ✨ Features

* **Dockerized Environment**: Runs in a lightweight `python:alpine` container.
* **PDF Export**: Uses headless **Chromium (Selenium)** to scrape and print pages to PDF with high fidelity.
* **Optimize for Performance**:
  * Includes a customized `mlib_download.py` downloader with low-resource tuning (memory management, eager loading, flag optimizations).
  * Supports concurrently downloading multiple pages.
* **Integrated Plugin Stack**:
  * Pre-installed with a curated list of plugins: `mkdocs-material`, `mkdocs-jupyter`, `mkdocs-katex-ssr`, `mkdocs-table-reader-plugin`, and more.
  * Includes custom LaTeX template support (`template.tex`).
* **Automated Workflow**:
  * Generates `mkdocs.yml` dynamically from `info.json`.
  * Builds the site, starts a local server, captures PDFs, and optionally compiles to a single document.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your machine.
* A compatible MkDocs project structure (containing `docs/` and `info.json`).

## 🚀 Installation

Clone the repository and build the Docker image:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RainPPR/mkdocs-exporter.git
cd mkdocs-exporter
make build
# OR directly with docker
docker build -t mkdocs-exporter .
```

## 📖 Usage

### 1. Project Structure

Ensure your documentation project has an `info.json` file in the root. This file acts as the manifest for the export process, defining metadata, navigation, and export targets.

### 2. Run the Exporter

Mount your project directory to `/app` in the container:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$(pwd):/app" \
  -e MAX_THREADS=4 \
  mkdocs-exporter
```

* **`-v "$(pwd):/app"`**: Maps your current directory to the container's working directory.
* **`-e MAX_THREADS=4`**: (Optional) Sets the concurrency level for PDF downloading. Default is 4.

### 3. Output

Artifacts (PDFs, compiled LaTeX files) will typically be generated in a `build/` directory or as defined in your `info.json` export configuration.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `MAX_THREADS` | `4` | Number of concurrent Selenium workers for downloading PDFs. |
